- Digital Filter Design
- Elements of digital image processing
- Sampling and quantization
- Image Transforms
  - Discrete Fourier Transform
  - Discrete Cosine Transform
  - Discrete Wavelet Transform
- Image Enhancement:
  - Enhancement by point processing
  - Spatial filtering
  - Enhancement in the frequency domain
- Color Image Processing
- Image Segmentation
- Representation and Description
- Morphological Image Processing:
  - Dilation and Erosion
  - Opening and Closing
  - Some basic morphological algorithms

This work was completed as part of the course 19AIE303 SIGNAL & IMAGE PROCESSING, under the guidance of Course Mentor Dr. Sowmya V, whose profile can be found [here](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=HQikt6IAAAAJ&hl=en).
